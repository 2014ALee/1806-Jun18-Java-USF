There are two type of interfaces: Functional interfaces and Marker interfaces

Functional Interfaces contain on and only one abstract method 
*defined in itself(inherited abstract methods don't count)
*have as many default methods as desired

Marker Interfaces have empty abstract methods
Example: serializable, clonable, remote
