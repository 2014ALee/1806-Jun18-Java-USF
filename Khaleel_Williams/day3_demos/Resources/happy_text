Put it in, leave it alone. Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show
the light. Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the
framework first. It's amazing what you can do with a little love in your heart.
Water's like me. It's laaazy ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do 
things Be brave.

Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. I spend
a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and squirrels, and 
little rabbits and stuff. See how easy it is to create a little tree right in your 
world. I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about. You're meant to have fun in life. We'll do another happy little painting.

Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. A big 
strong tree needs big strong roots. Anything you want to do you can do here. That 
is when you can experience true joy, when you have no fear. Use your imagination, 
let it go. Paint anything you want on the canvas. Create your own world.
