                HTML tags/elements

                    used to indicate how content should be displayed. Most have an opening and lcosing tag, 
                    those that do not are referred to as 'singleton' tag. Some examples of HTML tags include:

                    <p>     -       paragraph
                    <h#>    -       heading (replace the # with a number 1 - 6)
                    <div>   -       division/divider (used to group related elements together)
                    <img>   -       image (an example of a self-closing tag)
                    <a>     -       anchor (used to create links to other webpapges or to sections of the current web page)
                    <br>    -       line break (another example of a self-closing tag)
                    <hr>    -       horizontal rule (another example of a self-closing tag: places a horizontal line across the block)
                    <input> -       creates a field for user input (another example of a self-closing tag)

                Attributes 
                        
                        HTML elements can have attributes. Attributes provides additional information about the contents of 
                        an element. They appear within the opening tag of the element and are made up of two parts: a name and 
                        a value. The name and the value are sparated by an equals sign. The value of an attribute is wrapped in double
                        quotes, like a string.
