            <img>

                Used to add an image to the web page. It is a self-closing tag, so
                it has no closing tag.

                Attributes (not all-inclusive):
                    src     =   path to the image file (can be relative or external URL)
                    alt     =   provides a text description if the image does not load
                    title   =   used to provide additional info when hovered over
                    width   =   specifies the width of the image in pixels
                    height  =   specifies the height of the image in pixels
                    align   =   used to align an image with any surrounding text

        <img src="images/quokka.jpg" alt="A quokka" width="400" height="250"
            title="The quokka is a small marsupiel about the size of a domestic cat"/>

        <!-- The <img> tags works with multiple image formats (.jpg/.jpeg, .png, .gif, etc.)-->
        <img src="images/earth-spinning.gif" width="250" height="250" alt="Earth spinning animation"/>

            Where we place images matters. The palcement of an image will affect how the surrounding text

        <img src="images/bird-of-paradise-flower.jpg" alt="A Bird of Paradise Flower" width="100" height="100"/>
        <p>Strelitzia, whose common name is the bird of paradise flower, because of a resemblance of its flowers 
            to birds-of-paradise (Paradisaea raggiana). The species S. nicolai is the largest in the genus, reaching 
            10m tall, with stately white and blue flowers; the other species typically reach 2-3.5m tall, except 
            S. caudata which is a tree of a typically smaller size than S. nicolai. The leaves are large, 30–200cm 
            long and 10–80cm broad, similar to a banana leaf in appearance but with a longer petiole, and arranged 
            strictly in two ranks to form a fan-like crown of evergreen foliage. The flowers are produced in a 
            horizontal inflorescence emerging from a stout spathe.</p>
