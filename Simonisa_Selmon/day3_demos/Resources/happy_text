Follow the lay of the land. It's most important. If we're going to have animals around we all have to be concerned about them and take care of them. Almost everything is going to happen for you automatically - you don't have to spend any time working or worrying. All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind. This is probably the greatest thing to happen in my life - to be able to share this with you. Now we don't want him to get lonely, so we'll give him a little friend.

Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there. A happy cloud. We'll paint one happy little tree right here. Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper. Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort of just make themselves.

Nice little clouds playing around in the sky. We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing. This piece of canvas is your world.

This painting comes right out of your heart. This is truly an almighty mountain. Water's like me. It's laaazyÂ ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things But they're very easily killed. Clouds are delicate.
