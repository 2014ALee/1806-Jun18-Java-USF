You can do anything here. So don't worry about it. We don't have to be concerned about it. We just have to let it fall where it will. We don't make mistakes we just have happy little accidents. You have to make these big decisions. Of course he's a happy little stone, cause we don't have any other kind.

You can get away with a lot. We need dark in order to show light. Let's do that again.

Use your imagination, let it go. You don't have to be crazy to do this but it does help. Let's do it again then, what the heck. If you do too much it's going to lose its effectiveness.

What the devil. We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy. We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you loose into the world. You can create beautiful things - but you have to see them in your mind first. It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get my coat. It’s about to freeze me to death. Nice little clouds playing around in the sky. We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown.

The man who does the best job is the one who is happy at his job. Sometimes you learn more from your mistakes than you do from your masterpieces. Now it's beginning to make a little sense. Paint anything you want on the canvas. Create your own world. You could sit here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - or you could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush.

There comes a nice little fluffer. From all of us here, I want to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friends. Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. You can't make a mistake. Anything that happens you can learn to use - and make something beautiful out of it.

Nature is so fantastic, enjoy it. Let it make you happy. Even trees need a friend. We all need friends. It's amazing what you can do with a little love in your heart.
