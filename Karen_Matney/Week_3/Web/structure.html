            HTML tags/elements
                Used to indicate how content should be displayed. Most have an opening and closing tag, those that do not are
                referred to as 'singleton' tags, or self-closing tags. Some examples of HTML tags include:

                <p>     - paragraph
                <h#>    - heading (replace the # with a number 1-6)
                <div>   - division/divider (used to group related elements together)
                <img>   - image (an exmaple of a self-closing tag)
                <a>     - anchor (used to create links to another webpage or to sections of the current web page)
                <br>    - line break (another example of a self-closing tag)
                <hr>    - horizontal rule (another example of a self-closing tag; places a horizaontal line acrooss the block)
                <input> - creates a field for user iniput (another example of a self-closing tag)

        Attributes
            HTML elements can have attributes. Attributes provides additional information about the contents of an element.
            They appear within the opening tag of the element and are made up of two parts: a name and a value. The name and
            the value are separated by an equals sign. The value of an attribute is wrapped in double quotes, like a string.
