    <h1>IFRAMES</h1>
    <p>An iframe is like a little window that has been pasted into your web page. In
        this window we can see the other page. The term iframe is an abbreviation
        for "inline frame".
    </p>

    <p>One common use of iframes is to embed a Google Map into a page. The content of
        the ifram can be any HTML page (either located on the web server, or externally).
    </p>

    <iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d3520.5740667941377!2d-82.42700398413302!3d28.068027082643937!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x88c2c79893ff8725%3A0x5d7c5bad3ede5e76!2sNorthwest+Education+Complex%2C+Tampa%2C+FL+33613!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1530558242923" width="600" height="450" frameborder="0" style="border:0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

    <p>Another common use for iframs is to embed videos into a page. Video content
        is often included to support the other content of the page.

    <p>Alternatively, we can use the &LeftAngleBracket;video&RightAngleBracket; tag (HTML5)
        to embed locally (maybe external?) stored videos.
