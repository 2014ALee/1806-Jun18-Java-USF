        <p>There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens. We can <em>always</em> carry this a step
             further. There's really no end to this. Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried
              away - we <del>have</del> <ins>plenty</ins> of time. Every single &nbsp;thing in the world has its own personality 
              - and it is up to you to make <strong>friends</strong> with the little rascals. 
         </p>

         <p>What is <abbr title="=Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr></p>


        <p> There is no right or
            wrong - as long as it makes you happy and doesn't hurt anyone. When things happen -
            enjoy them. They're little gifts. This is probably the greatest thing that's ever
            happened in my life. You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it
            makes you happy.</p>
