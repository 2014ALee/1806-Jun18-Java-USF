            Attributes

                    HTML elements can have attributes. Attributes provide additional information about
                    the contents of an element. They appear within the opening tag of an element and are
                     made up of two parts: a name and a value. name and value separated by equals sign.

            Headings
                    h1 to h6 (largest to smallest)
