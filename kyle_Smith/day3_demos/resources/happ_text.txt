There is no right or wrong - as long as it makes you happy and doesn't hurt anyone. Working it up and down, 
back and forth. Let's build an almighty mountain. Now it's beginning to make a little sense. 
I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and squirrels, and 
little rabbits and stuff. This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are.

In life you need colors. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. Let the paint work.

It's hard to see things when you're too close. Take a step back and look. Use what you see, don't plan it. 
We don't want to set these clouds on fire. Just a happy little shadow that lives in there. 
Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be.

This is the fun part They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. 
But sometimes I put even numbers—just to upset the critics. Be careful. 
You can always add more - but you can't take it away. This is unplanned it really just happens. 
Get tough with it, get strong.

If it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will get better.
We don't have to be concerned about it. We just have to let it fall where it will. 
Don't fiddle with it all day. You could sit here for weeks with your one hair brush trying 
to do that - or you could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush. Everyone needs a friend. 
Friends are the most valuable things in the world.

I guess that would be considered a UFO. A big cotton ball in the sky. This is the time to get out 
all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse.
 I get carried away with this brush cleaning. Little trees and bushes grow however makes them happy. 
Every highlight needs it's own personal shadow.

Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger. 
Here we're limited by the time we have. A little happy sunlight shining through there.
