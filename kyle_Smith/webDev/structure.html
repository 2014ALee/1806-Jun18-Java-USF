		<p>As trees get older they lose their chlorophyll. Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. We must be quiet, soft and gentle. A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him.</p>
		<p>See there, told you that would be easy. Just make little strokes like that. This is probably the greatest thing to happen in my life - to be able to share this with you. No worries. No cares. Just float and wait for the wind to blow you around. Every highlight needs it's own personal shadow. Do an almighty painting with us.</p>
		<p>That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue. All you have to do is let your imagination go wild. Those great big fluffy clouds.</p>
