Trees grow however makes them happy. Use your imagination, let it go. Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain.

There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens. We don't have to be concerned about it. We just have to let it fall where it will. If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see. You can create beautiful things - but you have to see them in your mind first. That's what makes life fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that you want. With practice comes confidence.

Painting should do one thing. It should put happiness in your heart. This is your world, whatever makes you happy you can put in it. Go crazy. This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse.

Everyone needs a friend. Friends are the most valuable things in the world. I'm going to mix up a little color. We’ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue. A tree cannot be straight if it has a crooked trunk.

If you overwork it you become a cloud killer. There's nothing worse than a cloud killer. Let's make a happy little mountain now. Get tough with it, get strong.

These trees are so much fun. I get started on them and I have a hard time stopping. Take your time. Speed will come later. Now we don't want him to get lonely, so we'll give him a little friend. Making all those little fluffies that live in the clouds. If we're going to have animals around we all have to be concerned about them and take care of them. Remember how free clouds are. They just lay around in the sky all day long.

Have fun with it. That is when you can experience true joy, when you have no fear. A happy cloud. That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue. Let's go up in here, and start having some fun
