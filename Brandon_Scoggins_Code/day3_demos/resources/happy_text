We need dark in order to show light. You have to make these big decisions. Here we're limited by the time
 we have. Let your imagination be your guide. It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get my coat. It’s 
 about to freeze me to death.

This piece of canvas is your world. You're meant to have fun in life. There is no right or wrong - as long 
as it makes you happy and doesn't hurt anyone. Every day I learn. The first step to doing anything is to 
believe you can do it. See it finished in your mind before you ever start.

Let's put some highlights on these little trees. The sun wouldn't forget them. We'll lay all these little 
funky little things in there. Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend. Let your 
heart be your guide. You can't make a mistake. Anything that happens you can learn to use - and make something 
beautiful out of it.

This is probably the greatest thing that's ever happened in my life. Everything is happy if you choose to make
 it that way. Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. You're the greatest thing 
 that has ever been or ever will be. You're special. You're so very special. Those great big fluffy clouds.
