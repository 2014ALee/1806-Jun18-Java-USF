                <p>     -   paragraph
                <h#>    -   heading (replace the # with a number 1 - 6)
                <div>   -   division/divider (used to group related elements together)
                <img>   -   image (an example of a self-closing tag)
                <a>     -   anchor (used to create links to ohter webpages or to sctions of the current webpage)
                <br>    -   line break (another self-closing tag)

            Attributes
                HTML elements can have attributes. Attributes provide additional infromation about the contents 
                of an element. They appear whiin ethe opeing tabe of the elemnt and are made up of two aprts: a 
                name and a value. The name and the value are separeted by an equals sign. The value of an attribute 
                is wrapped in double quotes, like a string.
