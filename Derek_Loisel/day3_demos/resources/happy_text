We can always carry this a step further. There's really no end to this. We don't have anything but happy trees here. 
Everybody needs a friend. Just go back and put one little more happy tree in there. Use absolutely no pressure. 
Just like an angel's wing. A fan brush is a fantastic piece of equipment. Use it. Make friends with it.

Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted. Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - 
but you have to build the framework first. Use what happens naturally, don't fight it. Look around, look at what we have. 
Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it.
