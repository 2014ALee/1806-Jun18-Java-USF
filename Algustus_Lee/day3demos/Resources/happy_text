You can create beautiful things - but you have to see them in your mind first. From all of us here, I want to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friends. With practice comes confidence. And right there you got an almighty cloud. Trees live in your fan brush, but you have to scare them out. Just think about these things in your mind - then bring them into your world.

That's crazy. I'm gonna start with a little Alizarin crimson and a touch of Prussian blue Now, we're going to fluff this cloud. The first step to doing anything is to believe you can do it. See it finished in your mind before you ever start. Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at? You gotta think like a tree.

We'll put some happy little leaves here and there. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain.

Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. Let's build an almighty mountain. Let's make a nice big leafy tree. I really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself. There comes a nice little fluffer.

You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy. Use your imagination, let it go. We'll play with clouds today. Working it up and down, back and forth.
